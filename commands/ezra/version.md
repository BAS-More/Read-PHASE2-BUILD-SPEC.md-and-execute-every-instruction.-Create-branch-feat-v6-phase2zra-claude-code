description: "Version control for all EZRA state. Tracks every change to decisions, documents, governance, knowledge, and plans with immutable changelog. Usage: /ezra:version (show current), /ezra:version log (full history), /ezra:version snapshot (create named checkpoint), /ezra:version diff <v1> <v2> (compare two versions)."

You are managing the EZRA versioning system — the immutable audit trail of every governance change.

If `.ezra/` does not exist, tell the user to run `/ezra:init` first and stop.

## Core Principle

**Every change to `.ezra/` state is versioned.** Decisions, documents, governance rules, knowledge, plans, scan results — all tracked. Nothing drifts silently. Nothing is lost.

## State: `.ezra/versions/`

```
.ezra/versions/
├── changelog.yaml          # Append-only log of every state change
├── snapshots/              # Named checkpoints (manual or milestone-based)
│   ├── v1.0.0-init.yaml   # Initial state snapshot
│   ├── v1.1.0-mvp.yaml    # Named milestone snapshot
│   └── ...
└── current.yaml            # Current version metadata
```

### current.yaml Format

```yaml
version: <semver>
created: <ISO — when EZRA was initialized>
updated: <ISO — last state change>
total_changes: <count of changelog entries>

counts:
  decisions: <total across all statuses>
  documents: <total existing>
  scans: <total completed>
  plans: <total registered>
  risks: <total tracked>
  proposals: <pending count>

integrity:
  last_health_check: <ISO or "never">
  health_score: <0-100 or null>
  governance_compliant: <true/false/unknown>
```

### changelog.yaml Format (Append-Only)

```yaml
log:
  - id: CHG-001
    timestamp: <ISO>
    version_before: "1.0.0"
    version_after: "1.0.1"
    type: DECISION | DOCUMENT | GOVERNANCE | KNOWLEDGE | PLAN | SCAN | RISK | PROPOSAL | SNAPSHOT
    action: CREATED | UPDATED | SUPERSEDED | DELETED | APPROVED | REJECTED | APPLIED
    target: <specific item ID or path>
    summary: <one-line description of what changed>
    triggered_by: <user | doc-sync | scan | guard | auto>
    
  - id: CHG-002
    timestamp: <ISO>
    ...
```

**This file is APPEND-ONLY. Entries are never modified or deleted.** This is the audit trail.

## Argument Parsing

- `/ezra:version` → Show current version state
- `/ezra:version log` → Show full changelog (most recent first, paginated)
- `/ezra:version log <n>` → Show last N entries
- `/ezra:version log --type <type>` → Filter by change type
- `/ezra:version snapshot <name>` → Create a named checkpoint
- `/ezra:version diff <v1> <v2>` → Compare two snapshots
- `/ezra:version bump <major|minor|patch>` → Manual version bump with description

## ACTION: snapshot <name> — Create Checkpoint

1. Read ALL current `.ezra/` state
2. Create `.ezra/versions/snapshots/<version>-<name>.yaml`:

```yaml
snapshot:
  name: <user-provided name>
  version: <current version>
  timestamp: <ISO>
  description: <ask user or auto-generate from recent changes>
  
  state:
    decisions:
      total: <n>
      active: <list of IDs and one-line summaries>
      superseded: <list of IDs>
    
    documents:
      total: <n>
      by_phase:
        pre_dev: <list of IDs with versions>
        dev: <list of IDs with versions>
        post_dev: <list of IDs with versions>
      coverage: <pct>
    
    governance:
      protected_paths: <count>
      standards: <list>
      enforcement: <config summary>
    
    knowledge:
      confidence: <level>
      architecture: <1-line summary>
      last_scan: <date>
      health_score: <score>
    
    plans:
      active: <list with completion %>
    
    risks:
      open: <list of IDs and summaries>
      managed: <count>
      closed: <count>
    
    metrics:
      total_changelog_entries: <n>
      total_scans: <n>
      total_proposals: <created / approved / rejected>
```

3. Append to changelog
4. Bump patch version
5. Report: "✅ Snapshot '<name>' saved at v<version>"

## ACTION: diff <v1> <v2> — Compare Snapshots

Load two snapshots and compare:

```
EZRA VERSION DIFF

```

## ACTION: bump <major|minor|patch> — Manual Version Bump

1. Ask: "Description for this version bump?"
2. Increment version per semver:
   - **major**: Breaking governance changes, new project phase, major restructure
   - **minor**: New decisions, new documents, significant scan results
   - **patch**: Document updates, minor governance tweaks, proposals applied
3. Update `current.yaml`
4. Append to changelog
5. Optionally auto-create snapshot for major/minor bumps

## Auto-Versioning Rules

Other EZRA commands MUST call the versioning system when they modify state:

| Command | Version Bump | Changelog Entry |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| `/ezra:decide` | patch | DECISION CREATED |
| `/ezra:doc create` | patch | DOCUMENT CREATED |
| `/ezra:doc-approve` (apply) | patch | DOCUMENT APPLIED |
| `/ezra:doc-approve` (reject) | — | PROPOSAL REJECTED (logged, no bump) |
| `/ezra:scan` | patch | SCAN COMPLETED |
| `/ezra:guard` (violations found) | — | GUARD VIOLATION (logged, no bump) |
| `/ezra:reconcile` | patch | RECONCILIATION COMPLETED |
| `/ezra:init` | major (1.0.0) | EZRA INITIALIZED |
| Phase change | minor | PHASE CHANGED |

**Every command that writes to `.ezra/` must also write to `changelog.yaml` and update `current.yaml`.** This is enforced by convention in the command definitions — each command's instructions include the versioning step.

## Rules

- **changelog.yaml is APPEND-ONLY.** Never modify or delete entries.
- **Every state change gets a changelog entry.** No silent modifications.
- **Snapshots are immutable.** Once created, never modified.
- **Version numbers only go up.** No rollbacks to lower versions.
- Auto-version bumps are always patch. User can manually bump minor/major for milestones.
